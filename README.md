# LeetCode C Problems

This repository contains over 70 beginner-level exercises in the C programming language. These exercises were completed by a student as part of a self-study routine to reinforce programming fundamentals and problem-solving.

Each exercise is written in a separate `.c` file, so it is easy to study, compile, and execute them individually.
