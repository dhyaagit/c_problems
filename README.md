# LeetCode C Problems

This repository contains over 70 beginner-level exercises in the C programming language. These exercises were completed by a student as part of a self-study routine to reinforce programming fundamentals and problem-solving.

Each exercise is written in a separate `.c` file, so it is easy to study, compile, and execute them individually.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Exercises span a variety of basic programming concepts, including:

- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers (basic usage)
- Recursion
- Mathematical and algorithmic problem-solving

---
## 📝 Exercise Source

All exercises are from (https://www.coodemaroc.com) , a website offering a wide range of C programming exercises suitable for beginners and intermediate learners.

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the `.c` files, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Switch into the directory containing the target `.c` file.
3. Compile the file using `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection):

```bash
   gcc filename.c -o filename
```
